This repository demonstrates an uncommon but potentially problematic behavior in Kotlin involving the `removeIf` function on mutable lists. The `removeIf` function modifies the list directly, which can lead to unexpected side effects if not handled carefully. The example shows a scenario where this behavior might cause a bug and includes a solution that creates a new list, preserving the original list.
